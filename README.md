HOW TO START:

Download nodeJS v7.3.0 (one I used, later ones SHOULD work)
Get this git onto your drive
Go to the folder of the git and open up CMD.exe AS ADMINSTRATOR
type "npm install", this can take a while.
type "npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest"
type "npm install d3"
type "npm install @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap@latest"
type "npm start"
